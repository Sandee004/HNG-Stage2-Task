    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <span class="name" data-testid="slackDisplayName">Sandee.</span>
   I do not like phone calls but you can reach me via <span class="email" data-testid="slackEmail">oyarekhuas@gmail.com</span>
    </p>
    <p>My goals for the next 2yrs include I being all I planned to be. No more imposter syndrome. I would be a G
      Fullstack Web Developer as well as a certified Software Engineer. I would be fully grounded in my stack: HTML, CSS[Tailwind and Bootstrap inclusive], JavaScript, MongoDB amd SQL for databases, Python Flask for backend development, React with TypeScript and others I wish to learn in the future. 
      I would have earned the title of a Mid-level/Senior Fullstack Deveoper and would have ny own comfy workspace at home.
